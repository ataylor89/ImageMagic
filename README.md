# ImageMagic

To run the script, type

    python script.py

in shell or Terminal.

This will display the new image in matplotlib and save the new image to the transformations folder.

Using methods from imagemagic.py, you can rotate the image around the origin, reflect it around the x and y axes, and transform it with a 2x2 transformation matrix.
